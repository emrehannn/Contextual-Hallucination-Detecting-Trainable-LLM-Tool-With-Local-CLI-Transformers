# You need a hugging face account with llama2 access to run the project as is. If you've not been granted access you can apply for it, or use a different model.
# Enter your hugging face access token in the HF token section of the code, its in the first few lines.
# If you don't want to use llama2, you can download the training data of LookBack Lens and train your own models, its not as hard as it sounds!
# Be sure to pick an open source model with exposed attention weights, this is very important!
#
# For PyTorch, the exact command depends on your OS and CUDA version.
# Go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to get the correct command.
# Example for CUDA 12.8: (replace if you use a different CUDA version e.g., cu118):
# pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# 
# If pip struggles, install PyTorch manually first using the command from the website, then install the rest.
